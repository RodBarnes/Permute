# permute
A simple command-line program that reads the contents of a file (samples are provide as `simple.txt` and `complex.txt`) and outputs all potential combinations of those characters.

Input files must be formatted with each line containing a list of characters that could be in the related position of the output string; i.e., the 1st line contains characters that could be in the 1st position, 2nd line contains characters that could be in the 2nd position, etc.

Each line can contain any number of characters and each line does not have to have the same number of characters as any other line; e.g., one line may have five characters, another line may have a single character.
